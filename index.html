          This is a collection of modern resources on various undergrad level computer science topics, for someone with
          an interest in theory. Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">LibGen</a> if you can't
          buy these books. You don't have to do everything here, just the topics of interest to you. Almost all the
          material in each resource is self contained
          so will cover necessary background but being these resources are university level they will assume the
          student to be familiar with calculus. See <a href="#sec-2">2</a> section.

            It's possible to earn an accredited BSc degree online if you want to attend a graduate school to do
            research. <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/cs/">University of The People</a> offers a BSc in
            Computer Science, and is the cheapest fully remote option. UoPeople is only accredited nationally in the
            US, but there exists <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/global/presence/">worldwide degree granting campuses</a>
            to get around the regional accreditation requirement of US grad schools.
            UoPeople is structured with 5 terms per academic year, with F/T students taking 2 courses per term or P/T
            students taking 1 course per term. <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>(OU) in the UK
            offers Computer Science to students in the UK/EU and select other regions with testing centers, and other
            degrees like <a href="http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/q36">Applied Math w/Statistics</a>
            BSc(Hons) worldwide. The <a href="https://csc.uis.edu/program-information">University of Illinois</a>, <a
              href="https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-software-engineering">Arizona
              State</a>, <a href="https://ufonline.ufl.edu/degrees/undergraduate/computer-science/">University of
              Florida</a>, and <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/software-development-bachelors-program.html">Western
              Governor's University</a> are some of the schools that
            offer US regionally accredited fully online degrees. Before you apply to any of these schools, research
            them to make sure they are financially sound so won't disappear half way through your degree, and that the
            type of accrediation they offer will work for your future plans. Also consider <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32821678">free
              tuition</a> for international students in countries like Germany.
          </p>

          <p>
            An alternative strategy if the goal is grad school: do the theory courses here, contact graduate programs
            asking if they allow non-degree students to take their classes. Taking classes as a non-degree student will
            let you build up a formal academic background with recommendation letters in your chosen field to make this
            direct entry to PhD possible but of course you will have to pay for these classes yourself.
            Prepare a proper grad school <a href="http://3dpancakes.typepad.com/ernie/2009/12/reading-phd-applications.html">application</a>
            and remember this is a big risk for a department, especially if the department you're applying to is small
            and therefore needs to be more selective in who they admit. Anything you can do to show that you won't be a
            risk for them in your letter of intent will help your application.

          If you live near or wish to vacation to Raleigh NC (or possibly remote, ask him), for $500 (or see group
          rates when available) per course, you can hire this former CMU professor to <a href="https://calculem.us/">teach</a>
          you directly as a guided tutor introductory computer science regardless of your educational background
          covering <a href="https://calculem.us/classes/trees/">functional</a> data structures and other topics.
          Some of this material exists in lecture notes <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/15122-s16/schedule.html">here</a>
          from when he taught 15-122 <i>Principles of Imperative Computation</i>. I did have access to the lecture
          recordings at one point before they got paywalled and they are fantastic. It's a steal for only $500 to have
          a PhD give you guided personal instruction.

              It's possible to do (or at least model) every course in this list using Common Lisp, such as building
              your own domain-specific <a href="https://www.pvk.ca/Blog/2014/03/15/sbcl-the-ultimate-assembly-code-breadboard/">machine
                code</a> while completing 15-213 <i>Computer Systems</i>, or hacking together <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/fset/Site/FSet-Tutorial.html">purely</a>
              functional <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/funds/funds.pdf">data structures</a>, or writing your
              own pattern matcher, or simulating a turing machine, ect.
              Of course you will do the courses using their recommended languages and tools, but in addition to this,
              building your own toy prototypes for the topics here in CLisp can help you learn this material as per
              this axiom<a href="#sec-3-1">3.1</a> "people learn more when they discover something for themselves than
              they do if someone tells them about it."
              Another reason is the language hasn't changed much in decades, so older books which are now free, can be
              used.

              the Little Schemer with pencil and paper in a weekend though the authors recommend at least 3 sittings.
              The first in the series is <i>The Little Schemer</i> which teaches you to think recursively.
              The second is the <i>Seasoned Schemer</i> covering higher-order functions, which will help understand
              calculus. The differential operator is a higher-order function: given a function on the real line it
              yields its first derivative as a function on the real line.

            <p>
              “So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, it’s a all men’s school, ‘Men, look at, look to the
              person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn’t going to be here next year; one of
              you is going to fail.’ So I get to Case, and again I’m studying all the time, working really hard on my
              classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.
              In high school, our math program wasn’t much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college.
              But the calculus book that we had was (in college) was great, and in the back of the book there were
              supplementary problems that weren’t assigned by the teacher. So this was a famous calculus text by a man
              named George Thomas (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HJTYVOE94R83/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0201077795">second
                edition</a>), and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by
              Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the
              publisher of my own book.
              Our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that (from the book). I
              would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the
              teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was scared I
              wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to
              solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first.
              But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the
              assigned problems, and after that <i>I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve
                problems</i>”

          It is possible in a functional language like SML to do algebra with types, proving two types are isomorphic
          with the desired properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. It's also possible to abstract Lists
          and Trees into polynomials, as every polynomial looks like a sum of terms. As you will learn in 15-150 <i>Principles
            of Functional Programming</i>: <q>most functional datastructures have constant time access near the outer
            layer of their structure, ie: the head of a list or the root of a tree. However, access at some random
            point
            inside the structure is typically linear since looking at some element of a list is linear in the length of
            the list, and looking at some element of a tree is linear in the depth of the tree. Datatype derivatives

          The "functional" part in functional programming refers to mathematical functions, meaning functions where
          each input has a single output. The 2012 version by <a href="http://dlicata.web.wesleyan.edu/">Dan Licata</a>
          has the best lecture notes, optionally combine with most <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/lect.html">recent</a>

          on the success of teaching this course.
          SML is used because it's syntax and module system is simple, much like Scheme's easy syntax was once
          preferred for introductory courses so the complexity of the language gets out of the way and you learn the
          fundamentals. This course introduces you to programming with types, proving properties of programs, writing
          programs for parallel evaluation, and you'll find it surprisingly very intuitive making it easy to grok large
          programs.

            “[Computer science] is not really about computers - and it's not about computers in the same sense that
            physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri
            dishes&#x2026;and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think
            computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was
            about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it
            very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use.”

          This covers computer architecture from a programmer's perspective, such as how to write cache friendly code,
          and other optimizations for the x86-64 arch. You learn how to manually write loops in assembly
          and see how recursion works at a lower abstraction. You learn machine code instructions, how compilers work,
          return oriented programming (ROP) to bypass stack protections, the memory hierarchy, and networks. You could
          read K&amp;R's
          <i>The C Programming Language</i> for a brief intro, though this course will explain C as you go anyway and
          fully covers pointers at the assembly language level making it self contained.

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
        <p>
          A classic introductory computer science book on thinking about the big picture of programs with abstraction:
          finding general patterns from specific problems and building programs based on these patterns. An applied
          example of this is the package manager <a href="http://dustycloud.org/misc/talks/guix/chicagolug_2015/guix_talk.html">GNU
            Guix</a> and distro GuixSD, which is a GNU implementation of the NixOS <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4584.pdf">functional
            software deployment model</a>.
          Package builds, including entire system builds, are declared in one text file. The resulting software
          deployment is functional: build inputs go in such as compilers, customizations, environments ect, and a
          reproducible, immutable build comes out with a hashed identifier meaning you
          can do roll backs to previous successful builds. A recent GUixSD feature <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00833.pdf">gexp</a>
          (g-expressions) is a good example what can be achieved through syntactic extensions of the Scheme language.

            Unlike a traditional introduction to algorithms and data structures, this puts an emphasis on thinking
            about how algorithms can do multiple things at once instead of one at a time and ways to design to exploit
            these properties. It uses a language based analysis model to estimate complexity for abstractions such as
            garbage collection.
            Most of the self learning and discovery is done through the labs, try them.
